# Autoplaylists

## Introduction

Autoplaylists are one of the most important feature of Watora, it allows to autoplay songs forever while the autoplaylist is enabled. You can create as much autoplaylists as you want, and you can use them everywhere, whatever if you created it on another server.

## Manage autoplaylists

#### Things to know :

* You can create as much autoplaylists as you want. But only one personal autoplaylist.
* Your autoplaylist can have as much song as you want.

## Types of Autoplaylist

Basically there are two types of Autoplaylists.

### Basic Autoplaylist

#### An autoplaylist has :

* A name \(choosen when created\)
* Songs \(added or removed with `pl add` and `pl remove)`
* Settings
* Permissions

### Personal Autoplaylist

A Personal autoplaylist share the same attributes except that it doesn't have a name.  
It's called **your autoplaylist**.

It also means that `(autoplaylist)` in commands becomes `(user_mention)`.

**Examples :**

![Using only pl instead of pl start and mentionning someone to load his personal autoplaylist](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

![Mentionning myself to display my personal autoplaylist settings](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <p>Manages if the autoplaylist is auto shuffled when playing or not.</p>

  </thead>
  <tbody></tbody>
</table>| **`pl set (autoplaylist) --edit whitelist (+|-) [user]`** | Edits the Whitelist to chose who can edit the autoplaylist. |

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

### Autoplaylist permissions

* By default, an autoplaylist is Private and the Whitelist is empty.
* Everyone can start every autoplaylist.
* You cannot edit a private Autoplaylist if you're not in the Whitelist.
* You can edit a public Autoplaylist.

#### Private Autoplaylist

| Add a song in the autoplaylist | No | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| Remove a song from the autoplaylist | No | **Yes** | **Yes** |
