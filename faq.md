## Is Watora lagging ?

It depends, it can happen but the answer is mostly not.

#### First, check if the issue is in your side

Ask someone if he has the same lags at the same time than yours.  
If he doesn't, then you may want to check your CPU and disk usage. Ensure that you have enough bandwidth too. Maybe check your voice channel’s bitrate \(right click and edit channel\). 

#### Second, check if the issue is from Discord

Are the other members/bots in the voice channels also lagging ? If yes, it can be a Discord issue. Check there isn’t a [Discord issue](https://status.discordapp.com/). It's also recommended to try to change your server region in the server settings.

#### Third, ask on Watora's server

Maybe there's another issue, do not hesitate to contact our team on the [support server](https://discord.gg/ArJgTpM).
