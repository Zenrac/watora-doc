## Is Watora lagging ?

It depends, it can happen but the answer is most likely no.

#### First, check if the issue is on your end

Ask someone if they have the same lag at the same time as you.  
If they don’t, then you may want to check your CPU and disk usage. Ensure that you have enough bandwidth too. Check your voice channel’s bitrate as well \(right click and edit channel\). 

#### Second, check if the issue is from Discord

Are the other members/bots in the voice channels lagging as well ? If yes, there may be an issue with Discord. Check that there isn’t a [Discord issue](https://status.discordapp.com/). If Discord is clear and the issue is still unresolved, try changing your server region in the server settings module.

#### Third, ask for help on Watora's support server

Maybe there's another issue. Do not hesitate to contact our team on the [support server](https://discord.gg/ArJgTpM).
