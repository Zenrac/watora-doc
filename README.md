## Get started with this wiki

{% hint style="danger" %}
 **Make sure to read this before reading another part of the wiki :**

* Do not literally write `[ ] ( )` in your commands. 
* Sometimes you'll have to write the vertical bar, it generally happens when you can specify several roles/texts.. It doesn't apply when the veritcal bar is written without spaces between two parameters.
* This wiki doesn't display it but every commands are called with a prefix.
{% endhint %}

Welcome to **Watora's Documentation** !

I hope you'll find enough help to **fully understand** Watora. If you want to correct, edit, add or remove something on this Wiki, you can go on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/Zenrac/watora-doc). Your help will be gladly accepted ! 

## Setup the bot

Watora doesn't need any setup, it's designed to be intuitive.

But you can configure many things, take a look the the [settings page.](configuration/settings.md)

## Setup Autoplaylists

You can find a cool page to learn everything about Autoplaylists [here](features/autoplaylists.md).

## Create your own commands and aliases

If you want to create your own commands and your own aliases you'll have to use CustomCommands, maybe you should take a look to the[ CustomCommands page.]()
